# griffin's Create Task
#### You might be asking yourself, what is this?
That's a great question. Haven't figured that out yet. Current plan is to have some form of automatic calculator, split up into different subjects.


Well. I finished. Hopefully. 

### What can this code do?
* Geometry
   * Volume
   * Surface Area
* Algebra
   * Simple Calculator
   * Solve an equation when X is equal something. 

### Will you ever add more? 
Probably not. The only reason I did this so early (my class hasn't started working on their tasks yet, they don't know how to code) was so I could have free time in that class to be able to learn C# and Unity. I'll link the rep to it here whenever I make it, but I'll be working on a game.
