# griffin's Create Task
I overcomplicated this way too much. Oh well.

## THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE PROJECT! IT IS STILL VERY BUGGY AND SOME OF THE MATH MAY/IS PROBABLY WRONG


#### ~~Well. I finished. Hopefully.~~ Spoiler: I didn't. I'm re-doing everything so it works through a GUI now.

### What can this code do?
* Geometry
   * Volume
   * Surface Area
* Algebra
   * Simple Calculator
   * Solve an equation when X is equal something.
