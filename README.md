#### You might be asking yourself, what is this?
That's a great question. Haven't figured that out yet. Current plan is to have some form of automatic calculator, split up into different subjects.


#### Well. I finished. Hopefully. 

### What can this code do?
* Geometry
   * Volume
   * Surface Area
* Algebra
   * Simple Calculator
   * Solve an equation when X is equal something. 

### Will you ever add more? 
Probably not. I'm going to be learning C# and Unity now. I'll link the rep to it here whenever I make it, but I'll be working on a game.
