#### You might be asking yourself, what is this?
That's a great question. Haven't figured that out yet. Current plan is to have some form of automatic calculator, split up into different subjects.

* Geometry
  * Volume
  * Surface Area
* Algebra
  * Solving for X, Y, other variable
  * Simple calculator - equation -> answer.
* Pre-Calculus/Calculus
  * Polynomials
  * Graphing 
  * Factoring
**DISCLAIMER!!** *The precalc is very unlikely to happen, because that seems hard. I don't know. I haven't looked it up yet.*
